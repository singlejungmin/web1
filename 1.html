<P>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specipication">HyperText Markup Language</a>, or HTML is the <strong>standard markup <u>language</u></strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</P>
